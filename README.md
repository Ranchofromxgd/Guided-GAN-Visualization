This code provide a simple example for our work

This example only have one pre-trained generator. If you need more pre-trained generator and pre-trained classifier,reference is listed as below:

**DCGAN mnist model**

**CNN mnist classifier**

This may not a well-trained GAN, but it do visualize the training process
